    <h1>Jenell's Journey</h1>
    <p class = "page-description">There once was a girl named Jenell with a passion for Spanish language and cultures and being the best mom possible.  
        She has held a diverse array of jobs in the past; however, the most important job, for which she earns zero PTO or salary, is being a mom to 2 boys, appearing in the photo below for your viewing pleasure.
       She currently lives in Westminster, Colorado with her husband Alberto and her Meyers parrot named Pio.</p>
